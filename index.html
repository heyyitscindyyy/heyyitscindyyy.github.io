  <p1>I have two younger siblings. My sister is thirteen and my brother is fifteen.
    My dad's name is Jorge and my mom's name is Irene. Both of my parents were born
     in Mexico. My dad is from a small town near Léon and my mom is from Michoácan.
     I also have an eight year old dog named Lucho. He is a terrier mix. My family from
   my mom's side of the family live in Illinois but my family from my dad's side of
 the family lives in Pennsylvania. </p1>

  <p2>I like music. My favorite thing to do is go to concerts. I have been to
    more than 30 concerts throughout my life. I especially love general admission
     concerts because it is fun to camp out and be able to be front row to a concert.
     My favorite concert of all time was a Twenty One Pilots concert I attended
     two years ago. I was in the second row and got to touch the drummer's hand.
   The next concert I am going to is an AJR concert. It is their lollapalooza
 aftershow and it is also general admissions. I love concerts because it is a fun way
to listen to music and be surrounded by people who also like the same music as you.</p2>

  <p3>I go to Benet Academy in Lisle, Illinois. I play the violin and I am in
    two choirs. I am an alto 1 in my school's concert chorale and I am a soprano
     2 in my school's mass choir. I like math so I am a part of math team. I am a
     peer tutor for math. I am a part of recycling club at school because I am
     passionate about protecting the environment. I am also a part of SALT and
     Marians, which are two religous groups on campus. SALT stands for serving 
     and loving together and Marians is an all girls religious group. I am also
     a board member of NHS. </p3>
